/* 8KYU Grasshopper - Create the rooms

Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    name: {
      first: 'Dark Side',
      second: 'The Odd Side',
      third: 'The Last Side'
    },
    description: {
      first: 'It is really dark in here innit',
      second: 'Not really',
      third: 'Bye'
    },
    completed: {
      first: true,
      second: false,
      third: false
